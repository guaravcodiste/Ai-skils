Place the running corridor image here as `running-corridor.jpg`.

The image should show:
- A person running away from the viewer
- A modern, well-lit corridor or tunnel
- Warm lighting from linear fixtures
- Motion blur effect in the background
- Dark athletic attire on the person

If the image is not found, the component will fall back to a gradient background.
